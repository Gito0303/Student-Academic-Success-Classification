About the Project
=================

**Student Academic Success Classification** is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict the academic success of students using various factors. These factors include demographic data, academic performance, and other personal information. The goal is to classify students into three categories based on their predicted academic success:

- **Dropout**
- **Graduate**
- **Enrolled**

This project utilizes multiple machine learning models to perform classification tasks, including:
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- **Random Forest**

The project provides an interactive web-based application developed using **Streamlit**, where users can input student data and receive predictions about the student's academic success. The app also visualizes the predictions and helps users explore the results through graphical representations.

Project Outcomes
----------------

The main outcomes of this project include:

1. **Predicting Student Academic Success**: Using the trained models, users can classify the academic success of students based on input features. This allows institutions to better understand factors contributing to student success and make data-driven decisions to improve educational outcomes.

2. **Interactive Web Application**: An easy-to-use web interface that allows users to input student data, run the classification model, and view the results in real-time. The web app is built using **Streamlit** and can be accessed interactively.

3. **Model Comparison**: The project compares the performance of different models, including **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**, **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**, and **Random Forest**, to evaluate which model performs best for predicting academic success.

4. **Visualization of Results**: The application provides users with clear visualizations that display the model's predictions, the probability of success in different categories, and any trends or patterns in the data.

Applications and Benefits
-------------------------

This project has practical applications in education institutions and can be used to:

- **Early Intervention**: Identify students who may be at risk of dropping out and offer support to improve retention rates.
- **Academic Planning**: Provide insights for academic advisors and departments to tailor their curriculum and support systems.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Enable institutions to use data to make informed decisions about student success and academic performance.

Future Improvements
-------------------

- Integrating additional data sources (e.g., attendance, socioeconomic background) for more accurate predictions.
- Implementing more advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for improved model performance.
- Expanding the application to include additional features like real-time data collection and long-term prediction tracking.
